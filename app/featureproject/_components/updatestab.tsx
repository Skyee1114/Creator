                    <p className="text-[#838694]">Dear CREAT'OR Community, We are thrilled to announce an important milestone in our journey - the successful deployment and subsequent audit of our CRET token. Following the deployment, we engaged Solid Proof, a leader in blockchain security and smart contract audits, to conduct a thorough examination of our smart contract to ensure its integrity and security.
                        Audit Overview: The audit by Solid Proof was comprehensive, focusing on identifying any potential security vulnerabilities within our smart contract and ensuring adherence to the best practices in the industry.
                        Here are the key takeaways:
                        No Critical or High Issues Found: The audit concluded with no critical or high-level security vulnerabilities, affirming the robustness of our smart contract.
                        Low-Level Issues Addressed: Two low-level issues were identified, including missing events and the use of a floating pragma solidity version. These issues, while not critical, were important for the contract's overall security and functionality.
                        Informational Issue: An informational note was made regarding the absence of NatSpec documentation in parts of the code, which is essential for comprehensive understanding and transparency.
                        Proactive Measures and Redeployment: In response to the audit findings, we have taken decisive action to further secure our platform. This includes the redeployment of the CRET token to address and rectify the issues identified during the audit. The new contract address for the CRET token is 0x6d0bB9B6cE385e28EA4EBb7d76dCb3A1AaF7BC4b. This step underscores our unwavering commitment to security, transparency, and continuous improvement.
                        Our Commitment: This audit and the measures we have taken following it are a testament to our dedication to providing a secure and reliable platform for our community. We are grateful to Solid Proof for their meticulous audit and valuable insights, which have helped us enhance the CRET token's security and reliability.
                        We thank our community for your continued support and trust in CREAT'OR. Your support fuels our mission, and we are excited about what the future holds for all of us.

                    <p className="font-bold text-xl text-[#1b1f2e]">GotBit Contributions to the CREATOR Project: An Overview</p>
                    <p className="text-[#838694]">Token Distribution Strategy 
                        GotBit's audit and strategic planning have been instrumental in outlining a comprehensive token distribution model for the CREATOR project. The model is structured across various funding stages, each with its pricing, valuation, and tokens sold, reflecting a nuanced approach to market entry and growth. 

                        Funding Stages and Token Allocation 
                        • Beta Stage: Introduced at a price of $0.017 per token, offering a discount of 85.8333% from the public price, this stage aimed to raise approximately $596,133, valuing the project at $8.5 million. A total of 35,066,666 tokens to be sold, constituting 7.0133% of the supply. 

                        • Stage 1: Priced at $0.034 per token with a 71.6667% discount from the public price, to raise $906,667, doubling the valuation to $17 million. This phase sells 26,666,666 tokens, making up 5.3333% of the total supply. 

                        • Stage 2: With a significant price increase to $0.078 per token and a 35% discount, this stage will raise $2,100,800, valuing the project at $39 million. Approximately 26,933,333 tokens will be purchased, accounting for 5.3867% of the supply. 

                        • Stage 3 (IDO/IEO): Marked the final stage before public listing, with tokens priced at $0.12 each. Raising $800,000, valuing the project at $60 million, and distributing 6,666,666 tokens, or 1.3333% of the total supply. 

                        Release Strategy 
                        A thoughtful release strategy is advised, with a percentage of tokens being released on the Token Generation Event (TGE) which again will be handled by GotBit, subsequent releases structured over time to maintain market stability and ensure long-term project viability.

                        Listing Strategy
                        The listing strategy devised by GotBit includes both DEX (Decentralized Exchange) and CEX (Centralized Exchange) listings, ensuring broad market access and liquidity for the CREATOR project tokens. 

                        DEX Pool and Listing Fees
                        • A DEX pool was established with 833,333.33 tokens, backed by $100,000 to facilitate initial liquidity. 

                        • Listing and marketing fees for potentially Gate.io (a prominent CEX) will be meticulously planned, including a listing fee of $80,000 and a marketing fee often paid in tokens, valued at 416,666.67 tokens or $50,000. Additionally, a security deposit of $40,000 will be allocated for Gate.io, emphasizing the project's commitment to security and trust. 

                        • A substantial deposit for Market Making (MM) will be set aside, totalling 1,666,666.67 tokens or $200,000, to ensure smooth market operations and price stability post-listing. 

                        Conclusion 
                        GotBit's strategic oversight and comprehensive planning in the token distribution and listing phases have laid a solid foundation for the CREATOR project's entry and sustained presence within the cryptocurrency market. The meticulous approach to pricing, valuation, and market engagement underscores a commitment to long-term success and stability, positioning the CREATOR project as a significant contender in the blockchain and digital assets arena.
